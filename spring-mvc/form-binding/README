This project demonstrates how to use spring MVC form binding. It contains 
two samples with one using JSP and another using Thymeleaf template engine. 
 
Create project using maven arche type: maven-archetype-webapp. 

Edit pom.xml to include necessary dependencies and plugins. Config 
<deploy-path/> to specify where to place the generated jar files. Command, 
mvn war:war, deploys the war file to the destination folder. Update
project with new maven dependencies to get rid of the errors.

Create/update src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml. Define Spring DispatcherServlet
and map the servlet to an URL. The context root will be the war filename by 
default.

Create Spring context configuration file. By default this file is at 
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/<servlet name>-servlet.xml. Define the location of 
controller files and view resolvers. For the Thymeleaf template engine, 
specify the template engine and the thymeleaf view resolver. See
http://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/2.1/thymeleafspring.html for thymeleaf
spring configuration. 

For Thymeleaf, create Thymeleaf templates, employee.html and result.html. 
Create an entity bean, Employee, to model fields in a form. Create a 
controller, ThymeleafFormBindingController, to perform the request mapping 
and model/view association.
